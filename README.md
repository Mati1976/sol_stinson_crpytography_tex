# About
----
There is a Tex file, with a PDF generated by it, providing a part of solutions of 
exercises of Douglas R. Stinson's textbook [Cryptography Theory and Practice](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/CTAP.html#ciphertext "cryptography").

# Attentation
----
I couldn't guarantee the correctness of my solutions, but I do my best to pursue it.
And my friends, welcome to improve it!
